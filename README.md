CLNK
====

A very small, simple C99 single header library to extract the path from
Windows shortcut files (.lnk).

I wrote used [pylinker](https://github.com/perceptionpoint/pylnker)
as a reference.  I think the most up to date/maintained Python library
for lnk files is [LnkParse3](https://github.com/Matmaus/LnkParse3) but
I needed C/C++ and only needed the shortcut path itself so here we are.

There's documentation/example program at the top of the file and a main.c
that uses that example.
